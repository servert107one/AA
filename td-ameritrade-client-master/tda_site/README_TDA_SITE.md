## TDA SITE
This is the example json documents and JSON schema used on the 
[TDA Developer API](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis) site. The goal of placing it here is to periodically
do diffs of what was checked in when the model was initially created to
determine if TDA has since updated the schema. 

On more than one occasion the current API is still missing referenced
types such as most Forex / Currency and others. Also, some of the 
schema is not well formed, and the examples do not include all possible
types at times.
