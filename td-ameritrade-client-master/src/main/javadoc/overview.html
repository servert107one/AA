<p>
The <strong>TdaClient</strong> is your main interface into the API. Note that in TDA's documentation,
sometimes the term <em>client id</em> is used and other times <em>consumer key</em> is used.
They are the same. You should not have <em>@AMER.OAUTHAP</em> appended to the client id. That
is only used when creating a new refresh token.
</p>

<p>Create a <em>tda-api.properties</em> in your classpath with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tda.client_id</li>
  <li>tda.token.refresh</li>
</ul>

<pre class="code">
  TdaClient client = new HttpTdaClient();

  Quote quote = client.fetchQuote("msft");
  EquityQuote equityQuote = (EquityQuote) quote;

  System.out.println("Current ask price of MSFT: " + equityQuote.getAskPrice());
</pre>
