High-Frequency Trading Backtesting Tool
=======================================

This framework is designed for developing high-frequency trading and market-making strategies. It focuses on accounting for both feed and order latencies, as well as the order queue position for order fill simulation. The framework aims to provide more accurate market replay-based backtesting, based on full order book and trade tick feed data.

Key Features
============

The experimental features are currently in the early stages of development, having been completely rewritten in Rust to
support the following features.

* Working in `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ JIT function (Python).
* Complete tick-by-tick simulation with a customizable time interval or based on the feed and order receipt.
* Full order book reconstruction based on L2 Market-By-Price and L3 Market-By-Order feeds.
* Backtest accounting for both feed and order latency, using provided models or your own custom model.
* Order fill simulation that takes into account the order queue position, using provided models or your own custom model.
* Backtesting of multi-asset and multi-exchange models
* Deployment of a live trading bot using the same algorithm code: currently for Binance Futures and Bybit. (Rust-only)

A Quick Example
---------------

Get a glimpse of what backtesting with hftbacktest looks like with these code snippets:

The complete process of backtesting Binance Futures
---------------------------------------------------
`high-frequency gridtrading <https://github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest/blob/master/hftbacktest/examples/gridtrading.ipynb>`_: The complete process of backtesting Binance Futures using a high-frequency grid trading strategy implemented in Rust.

Migration to V2
===============
Please see the `migration guide <https://hftbacktest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration2.html>`_.

Roadmap
=======

Currently, new features are being implemented in Rust due to the limitations of Numba, as performance is crucial given the size of the high-frequency data.
The imminent task is to integrate hftbacktest in Python with hftbacktest in Rust by using the Rust implementation as the backend.
Meanwhile, the data format, which is currently different, needs to be unified.
On the pure Python side, the performance reporting tool should be improved to provide more performance metrics with increased speed.

Please see the `roadmap <https://github.com/nkaz001/hftbacktest/blob/master/ROADMAP.md>`_.
